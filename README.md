# Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Evaluation in Causal Effect Estimation

Investigating the interplay between causal estimators, ML base learners, hyperparameters and model evaluation metrics.

## Coming soon
- Summary of the paper
- Description of the experimental framework
- Links to datasets
- Links to raw results (predictions, metrics)
- Instructions on how to post-process the raw results to perform further analysis and potentially add new metrics
