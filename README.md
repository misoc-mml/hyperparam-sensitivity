# Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Evaluation in Causal Effect Estimation

Investigating the interplay between causal estimators, ML base learners, hyperparameters and model evaluation metrics.

## Paper
This code accompanies the paper _Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Evaluation in Causal Effect Estimation_ [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01412).

## Data and Results
All datasets and results (in progress) are available [here](https://essexuniversity.box.com/s/xi6ptui0162dlcaokg8vv0274napxcsi).

## Coming soon
- Summary of the paper
- Description of the experimental framework
- Instructions on how to post-process the raw results to perform further analysis and potentially add new metrics
